## Summary

The [ripple](ripple) folder contains front-end files of the CordovaSim. The plugin is based on the [Apache Ripple](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple) project. The code was built and modified for CordovaSim's needs. The actual files are taken from [master](https://github.com/yradtsevich/ripple-temp) branch of the project, which was previously a submodule.
